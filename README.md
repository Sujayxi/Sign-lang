# Sign-lang
Sign Language Recognition Using CNN: This project uses a custom-trained CNN to recognize ASL alphabet signs (A-Z) in real-time. It leverages Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for hand gesture detection and classification, displaying results on screen. Future plans include dynamic gestures and audio integration.
